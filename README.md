# Restaurant Review App
This app was developed as a project under the Udacity FEND Nanodegree curriculum. Its a mobile ready web application with caching features which fetches JSON data consisting of information about a list of restaurants in a neighborhood. The application then plots the locations of those restaurants on a map with the help of geo coordinates obtained from the API. A list of cards below containing the information and links of each restaurant are provided below the map.


## Instructions
* Download or clone the repository.
* Start a python server in the projects's root directory.
* Use the command: _python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000_ if you're using Python 2.X or _python3 -m http.server 8000_ if you're using Python 3.x.
* Log on to _127.0.0.1:8000_ in your web browser to access the app.
